"terror power expose ' tyranny ' lord chancellor have defend government plan introduce control order keep foreign british terrorist suspect under house arrest , where there not enough evidence they on trial . lord falconer insist proposal do not equate police state strike balance between protect public against terrorism uphold civil liberty . but thriller writer frederick forsyth tell news his personal response move . mortal danger aim at heart britain or say home secretary charles clarke . my reaction ? so what it not I be cynical or do not care . I care about this country very much . but 66 year I have be alive , there have not be one hour , day , one month , one year , there have not be threat aim at we . my point , british have always cope without become dictatorship . we have cope with fear without become state base on fear ; we have cope with threat without our country into land state threat but what blair government now seek do - create tyranny we from al - qaeda tyranny . I bear on 25 , 1938 . mortal threat back then be scruffy little austrian call hitler . week after my first birthday , threat have become reality . we be war . my father wear uniform five . after 1945 we yearn peace at last but 1946 winston churchill tell us - from baltic adriatic an iron curtain have descend across . behind iron curtain , another psychopath , another threat . josef stalin trigger cold war , berlin blockade 1948 . my whole generation be blight by it . we threaten by nuclear holocaust , nuclear wind , nuclear . we build shelter would have shelter . we spend our treasure on weapon instead hospital . we silly precaution . some fight it ; some march futilely against it . some pretend it be not there . cold war last 43 year , but remain parliamentary democracy by early seventy it be terrorism as well al fatah , black september , red brigade , but most all us ira inla . thirty more year ; policeman woman , over 600 soldier , more than 3,000 civilian , but we win because even ira bomb could not we become tyranny be why tyrant lose . civil right be as little as humanly possible . have be take secret protect covert source ; yes one judge , no - jury court have be when jury be terrorise . informant have be give from their crime win battle . but habeas corpus do not ; right appeal be not abolish . now threat islamic fundamentalism . its leader want destroy our society ; so do ira . it base fund abroad ; so be ira . it sleeper fanatic inside our society ; do ira . it extremely hard penetrate our agent ; so be ira . prime mover be not easy bring trial ; neither ira . but we do . without become tyranny . now blair government propose law system fascism communism . citizen can be arrest hold without or trial , not even on careful consideration an experienced judge , but whim political call government minister . be protect from terror government say , we must become . but tyranny base citizen 's terror . this not victory ; this defeat before shot . an interesting article - its good see widen participation debate but I suggest we move one step far . our own bomb bullet can only shatter peace , because invade foreign nation , imprison innocent ' hunt ' ' shadow ' can not destroy an evil mind , hatred heart . rather than focus effect , we should consider cause , because terrorism do not begin with bomb . not try foreign policy compassion , it can only enhance our democracy , our freedom . I agree with frederick forsyth . we really can not deal with terrorism by turn britain into fascist state . what we really need more from our security service our politician . if they do not have evidence bring these people trial , there probably not any . our security service behave like detective who having decide certain person guilty , rake over all kind obscure flimsy evidence try prove it , while real villain get away . remember there be no wmd . just person may have make some stupid naive decision do not make they terrorist . this overly ' politically correct ' society , it good see someone mr . forsyth speak out . yes , have be oppression by british government past , overstep place like ireland , but yes , we be still democracy where it rare arrest without charge / trial etc . ( apart from number prisoner belmarsh goal , example ) .this sign up human right , then pretend they only apply people with nothing fear , innocent people ( define by whom ? ) . when i d card become , datum collect will not be protect by data protection act , will be readily available people like gchq , with no control by person whose i d be check . threat now new . you can not threat past year with now . forsyth say 3000 over 30 year or terrorism ; 3000 people die one morning ny on september 11th 2001 . threat today terrorist will acquire nuclear or biological technology . kilo will flatten building , kilo plutonium will flatten city . you now have combination people who will perform terrorist act with technology rapidly become accessible . I agree , government probably encourage degree - hysteria talk up threat ; but talk - down threat do unacceptable too . problem with this issue not it important but fact general we brit can be so politically apathetic some time , we will just let this go without tell government no . however , as nation give world law true sense right individual liberty I hope this will prove be one step too far as somebody chinese , I can say this use be good place migrate start new life . whilst life be not perfect we could make well ourselves . we be riddle with red tape tell what we can or can not do . have be politically - correct we be not allow have belief or opinion . have prime minister who spend too much time meddle we politic affair which have little do with life british citizen at home or abroad . mr forsyth have do good job voice his opinion . let us hope bbc do not get gag let people express view . people have right know bbc 's role inform , educate entertain ... I agree . terrorist intend spread fear but reality it government which have spread fear , by its constant publicising this enemy so dangerous we must allow they ride roughshod over our right liberty . end , very thing we protect what we be give up name safety from this invisible enemy . terrorist have already win I absolutely agree with forsyth . yes we defend ourselves against terrorism but exist law seem be more than adequate . idea ` ` new terrorism '' demand new power erroneous . evidence any real terrorist capability uk scant . ricin , example , dangerous poison but it weapon mass destruction . what really worry enthusiasm mr blair his government authoritarian reaction attempt manipulate electorate through fear . if government have its way with i d card , track so on then totalitarianism win as such it then matter little whether we give terrorist or not . we will have lose precious freedom which bush blair constantly tell we we have they seek bring other . I agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth . I be shock at ease with which this government wipe out major portion liberty british people have enjoy century - right not be deprive our liberty without trial court . go right back magna carta , ordinary people have spill their blood right against government who think they ` ` know well '' . when you look at today 's britain , you realise orwell be only wrong about one thing date . frederick forsyth put it beautifully . government seek introduce police state . new power home internment without trial follow pattern include introduction surveillance via compulsory i d card link data basis , together with un - british we will have swear allegiance state at age 18 year . we be sleep - walk into this . wake up ! an interesting view but miss two crucial fact this new threat : 1 ) these terrorist acquire weapon mass destruction they will use they without mutually assure destruction keep cold war state tense balance . these people will use devastating force against we without any consequence . 2 ) terrorist be prepared use suicide bomber which mean they could kill innocent people on london underground we could do very little stop it . these terrorist be so deadly , we have come up with new tough response . it will be little late day when people outside london wake up one morning out london have be nuke . we will not have much society leave debate ! he be correct what say . mind you he do seem have forget disgraceful internment policy northern ireland which probably cause many idealistic if misguided young catholic join ira . administrative detention muslim could similar effect now . surely we public would be well if security service , than alert suspect terrorist by place they under house ( long ? ) be place suspect terrorist under surveillance maybe acquire sufficient evidence prosecute or even well prevent terrorist attack . do not usually have time mr forsyth 's largely right wing view but this time he have get it spot on . there no doubt be terrorist organisation who would like do harm u.k . but it very doubtful whether al - qaeda global organisation co - ordinate this . rise surveillance , i d card , plan charge road use by track every vehicle at all time , this stuff nightmare . add this new legislation which effectively mean protection law will be remove from anyone at whim home secretary , I genuinely wonder what sort world two child will inherit . where will this end . as it stand terrorist do not need attack . it be government will soon have it be people terrorise more they could very achieve with few bomb . mr forsyth have express exactly what my gut fear be about this propose legislation , but could not verbalise . thank you . mr forsyth seem forget killing trouble occur on side religious divide be carry out by killer from both side . he forget basic human right be then as now . experience judge sit over some great miscarriage justice during those time . very little return maximum alienation . these law emphasis on islamic threat will just do same . forsyth wrong . nature current threat new . no our armed force , as soviet threat eastern bloc be . it you i. terrorist aim kill indiscriminately . good comparison therefore blitz , . at this time , let we not forget , suspect ( foreign british be routinely round up intern war , without any complaint from public . we must not forget we be at war . I would say likelihood an attack by sleeper cell fundamentalist lunatic against major uk target ` ` when '' not an ` ` if '' probability . I will bet money you like after any such attack freddie forsyth will be say government do not do enough protect uk . people like forsyth can only see one side any argument he it side opposite new labour tony blair . I agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth . very reason country have be such wonderful place , under attack , not from terrorist but from this government . perpetuation perceive terrorist threat not because what ' ' terrorist be do , but from our own government . I believe what this government do , , at very least , highly at , sinister . at what point will feel they have enough control over every single person isle ; when we be all tag monitor constantly ? our be craftily surreptitiously whittle away by this government we be gain . it should be great concern everyone . I be slightly old than mr therefore have live through same history as he I be against police state would not like think I live . I attack on iraq make international situation bad may have provoke further act terrorism how true . there be extremely worrying parallel between britain now germany during 30 's . I think it would be so easy take over country from within . mr forsyth have one key point ; terrorist who threaten britain today be well aware , stalin , ira all fail . as result modern day terrorist be willing do thing predecessor do not . do not mean civil liberty modern britain be erode counter threat ; should be absolute last resort . but meet new threat , defeat sinister fanaticism today 's terrorist , we may need do thing little differently . let we hope not . frederic forsythe 's comment seem I be well - think - out why we ( human society as whole , britain particular ) should resist temptation over - through fear . it this fear which enable terrorist succeed end , terrorist can come all form , as mr . forsythe 's opening comment suggest I be remind quote attribute thomas jefferson . ` ` nation limit freedom name security will have . '' government be face with an incredibly task , have make policy deal with it . it be all very well criticise policy , but if mr forsythe can not draw on his year experience offer an alternative , I say ' so what ? ' his opinion . frederick forsyth 's rhetoric absurd his conclusion laughable . he distort reality serve his own against new labour . this government seek balance protection our with minimum loss civil right . frederick forsyth who extremist , because he do not appreciate need balance . I rarely find myself agree with my forsyth , but this instance I think he correct . rule must prevail , civil liberty be worth defend . if government can hold ' suspect ' without charge or trial , what be next ? agree absolutely . by introduce fascist type law we loose moral high ground our fight against terror . our democratic system not , but as churchill point out ` ` well than all other have be '' . terrorist attack will take place but many reason we should take personal risk return personal . I do not usually agree with mr . forsyth , but he spot on . single big threat we face government dedicate act illegally manipulate international national law its own purpose . totalitarianism always require an outside threat , justify range extraordinary power leader want . british government far great threat organisation . although , principle I agree with he , frederick forsyth fail address one key point- al qaeda attack ( obviously there have be yet uk ) seek kill maximum number people . ira want limit death toll attack so as support among republican movement . yes , I with mr . forsyth 's view . I do not government 's plan be justify . there over reaction negative influence we president 's interpretation democracy freedom . he use same argument current before wwii , war ` ` liberate '' , afghanistan with syria iran come . we be leave poor inheritance future generation . mr forsyth wonderful writer should keep his fiction where it belong british government not go down road mr forsyth suggest . sadly comment such as his will make lot people believe they be govern by people who be fast become tyrant instead be genuinely commit stop , even if method employ do at moment british people who have live democracy protect by tony blair other like mind who , mr . forsyth seem be put side ' scruffy little austrian . ' thomas hobbes would be smile his grave at labour proposition . like new labour , he call himself libertarian . like new labour , he believe he be promote people 's good interest . but as forsythe criticise this government , hobbe have be criticise by most subsequent philosopher argue his way into hand totalitarian . simply put , he argue favour ultimate liberty - liberty live - man should be prepare surrender all other liberty supreme , as protection against his fellow , barbaric , man . hobbe have be roundly condemn by posterity , so . I hope new labour suffer same treatment . I agree with mr forsyth 's view . government approach totally spirit british democracy . they must not allow get away with it . course frederick wrong about britain win war against ira he be wrong too about country not become tyranny . have he forget about shoot kill , torture , internment without , collusion with loyalist death squad etc ? my background somewhat similar freddie 's so I be persuade agree with many his sentiment we can have no moral impose our system government on anyone while we be systematically deprive our own citizen basic individual collective freedom . whilst keep potential terrorist house arrest might seem superficially attractive , it , unfortunately , also first step towards totalitarianism . who decide whom suspect ? why should we believe they ? who can have faith honesty , integrity , competence our intelligence service politician light event recent year ? what stop false denunciation ? what those falsely accuse who will their career ? who will support family ? will their child still go school it smack I method nazi germany , stalin 's russia , ceausescu 's romania - list go on it look as if new dark age come . I see opinion on mr forsyth 's remark be . problem I see those who support imprisonment without trial believe it will never happen they or their family , only people they do not like or be scared but history have show if you have law like , they always get abuse by those power . after all , you may be scared same people as those power but someday those power may be scare you ! day , you will be one imprison without chance justice . our law be such you can not just be imprison at whim our police force , you have be show be deserve it . if we imprison people without trial an indeterminate period , we be no well those we be fight . I never think it possible I agree with single word utter by frederick forsyth , but I ' m wholehearte agreement with he on this one . we , nation be grave danger be dupe by pro us propaganda , which course also mean we will inherit most , if not all their total paranoia , allow our government , any political incidentally , gradually , insidiously , impose police state by well try & test back door method . I grieve future my child , it be no wonder they be adamant they do not ever want any their own . this government , with much fanfare , sign we up european convention on human right but now want introduce indefinite house arrest without trial . this put it on par with government burma . many your respondent , I would not usually think mr forsyth as someone whose view share , but instance oppose charles clark 's proposal house arrest I agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth/ I agree",0

I believe this whole reason ` ` retro '' have become so popular . as as remake do justice original then all it can do create wide audience entice new generation enjoy revive old series . personally I would like see cartoon such as transformer , thundercat m.a.s.k . full hollywood remake . leave they alone , why ruin something we all have very fond memory first place ? thunderbird film be apalling , not patch on puppet series I grow up with roundabout will never be same without voice eric thompson . love see transformer real actor cgi . make it at least 15 rating . part reason success such classic as magic roundabout be character be not sweet cuddly creature you would expect . they be moody , sarcastic , rather human . just look at picture animation new film show these characteristic have not be preserve . dougal never smile like ! film this sort have an unfortunate habit disneyfye everthing , they just lose real magic make show special first place . I have fond memory bod not least which because I look like he ) would like see someone attempt make it into film . it be get all right material an american blockbuster - no plot story . bod would likely be play by tom cruise would undoubtedly have girlfriend or two . it be all very well remake these classic tv show film with all late ' new ' audience , but I lot original charm lose when they do this , seem more like money make exercise cash on original success programme reinvent or improve it . it maybe an audience who have never see original they can watch they without prejudice , but people have grow up with all these show such as thunderbird magic roundabout which be part our childhood , they be never go up expectation . it pose question though with all long line remake be make , be film - maker run out original idea all I can say bring back danger mouse , probably kid ' show . I recently re - watch some episode realise there be level humour danger mouse be completely lose on I when I be child . there be captain pugwash make couple year back . again , like so many these nostalgia programme , animation - this time computer create flat - cell like animation - fail match original 's cut out paper technique inventiveness , be inadequate . we live sample world - music industry have be pludere past decade inspiration , clip sound from 20 ago much cheap easier do something new . seem film tv do now - it be just cheap take idea from past rework , rather than be dare try something new it get mr.benn . story line about man who change fancy dress shop , step door way appear another time place would be amazing ! if they get decent writer story line could be great . who play lead role ? well if it be comedy then it have be someone like steve martin . its go be an adventure then johnny depp playing role similar pirate caribbean character . muffin mule perhaps ? all , grannie grandpas go cinema as well you know ! why can not british film industry try make gerry 's ufo or captain scarlet , saphire steel , or tomorrow people . today 's medium , it seem past future . tv show as battlestar galactica have new remake , dj 's be sample or re - work 70 's 80 's music . even computer game from 10 - 15 year ago be get modern re working . personally , I think it show no one have any originality more ! not just leave our misty - eyed nostalgia alone . mary , mungo midge . but course most episode lift would be out order they would have use stair . plus would mary be more vicky pollard character as she live high rise block ? yeah but no but I be not even there ! I would see mr . benn , with brad pitt title role . sean connery could mysterious costume shop owner . it demonstrate profound lack imagination today 's film - maker they continually try remake remodel past an effort cash on . there be plany modern child 's book would excellent film or programme , why not use they instead rehash past ? . benn with rowan atkinson as lead . would have love see dungeon & dragon make , but unfortunately film it make into do not come up scratch . only one not be as yet thundercat , which I would like see . I ' m an expat live norway , recently through period buying dvds many my child 's program my 2 daughter . dear wish , however , see feature length version noggin nog appear on big ! ! very scandinavian rainbow ! I believe children classic should be leave well alone , I will be surprised if magic roundabout do not do well at box office , especially since it will be go up against spongebob squarepant movie , popular among child because it be original , witty , modern . magic roundabout will never child today as it do all those many year ago how about classic like chorlton wheelie , , terrahawk , bod ..... oh list could go on on ! ! ! if transformer movie indeed card then I will be first one on amazon buying copy , eagerly at front door with frothy mouth nervous twitch . repackage my childhood sell I at an extortionate price ! I do not care ! till then I will have make do with citreon c4 advert . I would luv see willow on big screen but sadly without late kenneth williams do voice it would not be same . who remember trap door voice by late willie rushden , superb child 's programme . could morph hold his own big screen movie ? ? or even jamie magic torch .... hmmmmm , I could go on on . danger mouse ? at 34 I ' m my age . : - ) noggin nog be one good child 's program . problem with bring it big screen no - could approach oliver postgate 's wonderful voice . so general leave well alone . original good because they be their time method be an integral part story . just imagine what could achieve by use cgi remake fingerbob ... already disturb hand antic bearded hippy , yoffi could take on whole new level with more life - like fingermouse builder , postman pat fireman sam together an epic adventure fire , post brick . ultimate struggle save woman they love evil clown , krusty gobo . will they triumph or will they fail miserably ? find out this fall . one show I personally would love see make into live action movie joe 90 . it would be worth price",3

I never get feed up hear it whenever song on radio I turn radio up , smile sing along ( very badly , why radio have be turn up drown my voice out ) . song make I calm serene happy well do robbie . I think although robbie good performer , angel not really good song . it certainly not anywhere near as good as love will tear we apart by division or wuthere height by kate bush . fantastic song . all credit robbie guy chamber . it be song will play forever bridge all age group . do no way mantle . whenever we have these award it always ' artist ' from past five year seem win well well ... we forget about late 80 early 90 example . they be not cool at , because they be cool again now show song have great longevity than people think . yes angel good song since past 25 year , because it touch soul as carry lot meaning . I ' ve always dislike angel intensely . I believe it be symbolic general capacity british pre - teen , teen middle aged woman accept low quality/ low aspirational music as ` classic '' songwriting . it be ' orrible . it seem obvious I people who robbie be people who do not particularly like all much . folk without collection ; folk who have never engage madness one experience when fall under spell pop music . angel add nothing - it merely irritating distraction - wasp go away on summer 's afternoon picnic . what result . if you vote it - you should ashamed yourself - you probably only know dozen song or so not you - so where do off apply this uninformed filter cast this ridiculous vote . booo hisss angel , good song ? you be right ? last five year I might be willing , but 25 , no way . do whoever vote this actually have any music prior , say , 1995 ? really quite british industry past quarter century . no surprise about robbie williams consider list . where on earth do nomination list come from ? ? ? ? compile by an eleven year - old girl ? ? I mean , will young ? come on . what load crap , good song last 25 year - I do not think so ! ! what about all real artist out there over last 25 year - list endless , but robbie williams do not even come close . what joke song have become such bane I I have develop pavlovian response word ' angel ' where I thrash around , scream ` ` no no no no no '' until someone tell I ` ` radio be '' . why half - bake cheesy ditty like angel , which have become anthem million romantic sop ( think how many time it be sing on pop idol example , by whom ) , should be vote good song past 25 year , beyond I . if this song against which all other be judge , then musician may as well give up . why do we reward mediocrity so highly ? ? initial list be very weak anyway , but angel good song last 25 year ! ! ! ! think not , do not realize radio 2 have so many listener under age 10 ! ! people have such short memory ! great song yes , but well last 25 year ? not chance . I as oppose song have vote here . great british public at work again . it be mediocre , sentimental safe song . grant , it be not too bad , either . but can it stand up anything by smith ( particular ` ` how soon now ? '' ) or anything from stone ' first album ? nope . no , because I ' not female I ' m not 10 ! ok I like robbie angel decent song but it no way good song past 25 year ! shortlist be not great but he win it joke ! predictable laughable success angel at this year brit reflect poorly on state music over last 25 year . british public be brainwash corporate pulp presnete they as cut music true talent be sadly miss . whilst angel popular song not even good song robbie 's repertoire never mind good last 25 year . I be huge robbie fan love song . but I think there be lot more outstanding song / music out there influence music today , unfortunately they be leave out list . have radio 2 listener hear joy division ? band who , through album , have big impact on music , continue do so , over last year than robbie williams will . no doubt it there be not song do by anyone with more emotion feeling . people will adopt their slightly snobby stance , but angel have hit home with large audience than any other song . it should have be joy guy have play an influential part shape modern day music while angel remain yet another pop . I sincerely do not believe 25 year from now , most influential artist will argue robbie williams inspire art way byrd , nick drake have do music today . ! I think its brilliantly write song with different meaning different people . there other great song category ... but somebody have win ! robbie be deserve winner . I be astound such second - rate record have beat such line up amazing song ! it be terrible song , vote by masse who do not have brain appreciate innovative exciting music good song past 25 year ? really ? on , this surely joke ? no ? I think I need long lie down ... it just go show british public not have clue about good quality music when they pick robbie williams over beautifully kate bush division . I suppose it be confirm one thing - british public be consistently dull : - & lt ; ( no offence robbie , but pleeease ! there must be thousand well song than cheesy pop kid . no one agree with this quite frankly it an embarassment integrity british music further nail coffin ! I think robbie deserve , he have be most iconic any star we have have britain since john lennon an idol million worldwide . who say he do not deserve it jealous his success . only real challenger be queen hey , another one bite dust ! ! obviously all karaoke singers uk vote it . if this good song last 25 year then british music industry trouble sure robbie talented produce excellent material , but this not good record . sad day it be not type music I normally like but even as diehard rock fan I recognise it good song appela most people . be why it have be vote good song last 25 year . it be good all - rounder . just like robbie good song 25 year ? since 1980 ? I ' m confused . ` ` angel '' not bad . it nice , catchy , formulaic anthem tick all box . but this not great music if anything it be regressive . bland even .

I do not feel like urban music be just be celebrate by [ joss stone ] win or she be nominate , or brit acknowledge there be an urban music scene because it be all kick tooth at end day . it be not really relevant . if joss stone close thing they feel comfortable championing because what look like how she who she be sign , then so be it . it be get nothing do with what be really on . urban genre very broad . if you underneath urban , there be number core element include hip - hop , r b , garage into obviously come soul . joss stone soul . her first album be call soul session . so urban very broad brushstroke umbrella over top sub - genre , there be offshoot all those . joss stone have have amazing [ we ] give she be uk artist . what really capture everybody 's imagination here you have - year - old from devon with voice die bunch really , good tune she look good - I think be what be do it . award good british urban be vote by viewer mtv base . I not think joss be not worthy winner . she make soul music definitely come under category what we describe as urban . fact she be from devon interesting thing because most music cover make large city she be literally rural . great thing about urban music there be big range . if there some sort root with black music or dance music , I think be where can call it urban - 's where this new sub - category , or uber category , have come from . joss stone certainly not old enough have have some experience old soul singer , but you could not argue she be be inauthentic with her emotion - it come somewhere genuine . it have come across as real . 's only cut - off point we have here be only way by we judge people . what urban mean as an organisation politically correct term describe music which originate from black background . music should become inclusive if we be multi - cultural britain , then we should be fight inclusion rather than . if joss stone can be accept within urban music community , I think act from ethnicity do classical music rock be accept too race do not make difference if everyone include . out all award dish out yesterday , I ' m still trying find out what people other race receive any sort recognition or award . type music ( especially street music ) originate from city , typically reflect or characteristic urban life . she might not be urban , but when do r & b become hip hop taint thing it now ? r & b stand rhythm blue , remember joss stone rubbish certain . if anyone deserve win an award urban ( I think probably should include hip - hop , soul & funk at least but rock or pop ) this year its street , although dizzee rascal stake good claim she definitely deserve win prize , joss stone album quite simply , easily well than anything else be release last year . this whole debate about what urban , what be not urban completely pointless probably fuel by urban artist who be nominate or do not win . I can not see why people can not just congratulate her talent she . she do deserve it , but I agree with comment about urban music . its stupid phrase , particularly british . state they tend use hip hop r & b , if I say hip hop here lot people have no idea what I ' m talk about . very strange . what be name ? rise by any other name etc ... if people want call it urban , why not ? if we really analyse it , term ' dance music ' misleading it do not describe everything you can dance . whilst I agree term ' urban ' open interpretation , it strike I as simply weird joss stone have . ' urban ' I what I hear be play party inner city - I live brixton have never soul session pump out bass heavy sound system any party I ' ve be . good luck joss stone , let us celebrate her victory - let us also question , with artist so successful talente as jamelia , lemar , kanye west , dizzee , alicia key outkast - we do not see single black artist on stage collect an award . , what you be say any have black heritage allow be sing by anyone who not black . , if , then they should not be acknowledge it even if be pretty dam good at ? she be 17 , have an amazing voice , win . good on she . oh , but she be not ` ` black '' well , us make she feel bad about it then . how dare she ! though hang on do not so - call ' public ' vote on this one ? this idea pigeonhole whatever popular at time no different than what be 1940 50 relation what ` ` '' be . medium then call anything have swinge beat , syncopate melody or soulful feeling ` jazz '' , much chagrin artist . it would mean ` ` blue '' would be mould as ` ` bebop '' , ` ` cool '' ` ` ragtime '' all very different style at time . jazz be remain such massively misunderstood term . so what ` ` urban '' music ? truth it be lazy term categorise music you do not really understand . soul garage world apart musically ( marvin gaye v tuff jam ? ) , but no doubt have their connection . if we just let music speak not judge success an artist by number award win , then maybe we can enjoy music what it , rather than what it represent . I prize rural music ! suck cities- it be way well out here . we have hay , one thing . she from what have become know as urban music would be as bad as lenny kravitz or hendrix from rock music be black surely ? I do not understand point ty making . if lemar , who make music which less soulful than ' work win , he might have say nothing . ( btw I ' m black too ) how she be ` ` urban '' if she spend her life devon countryside ? nonsense . I love joss bit do not care what her branding - it be amazing music , full stop . stop put all bracket let us just call it music , let us especially drop / urban tag - nearly all music come from black origin this just set an example it ok pigeonhole people their music by their colour . surely point have an urban music category simply acknowledge artist be make what ( historically ) consider urban music irrelevent colour their skin , or where they originate from . joss stone singe certain type music can be consider urban style , just as someone from an inner city , indeed not from usa could sing music . if person be good at it authentic sound , would we criticise it be refer as country music or artist represent style ? term reference music genre uk have develop , part , from controversy surround brand mobo award . very term ' music black origin ' confuse offend many people . this strange give existence asian music award . appear use ' black ' or ' white ' relation music make people feel uncomfortable . term urban ' therefore , have be sidestep debate which type music come first ' black ' or ' white ' thereby render issue colourblind . result now redundant new debate as what ' urban ' also mean perhaps we should have create new term altogether describe various strain soul / rnb hip hop , one which not also mean something else - as we have do with ' crunk ' . urban just word be come about describe ` ` black '' music be become popular now . word be not even use , or common use five six ago . it be just way industry clumping it all together without having call it black music , because some people be oversensitive call they racist it . I ' m band have be ` ` urban , I despise label . I would hate think I belong any neat marketing niche , because be all it ever since music record comapnie try fracture what they consider ' music black origin , these label have be use status good music into commodity . look at all broadcaster , unable reach young people without condesende , they simply play some ' urban ' music on soundtrack as if its dreadful cheap lift music . label , it what it , just music as black man , I think I agree with some at least statement make by key executive . black people lead music they invent . should stop call genre meaningless , northe . real question would joss stone would have be do music she be do if be black ? same thing , with street , winehouse , etc . who be ever hear terri walker or rhian benson .. they be both time well than joss stone both they have urban music award I think mobo , but why not ? ? ? ? so what if joss stone win urban award . her music great soul surely under ' urban ' banner ? what if street have ? would people be whine because mike skinner white ... it seem lot fuss about race real issue should be music nothing else . urban pc version say music . I ' m doubt ms stone 's talent , but why do not jamelia or lemar get brit ? this",3

I think issue more fundamental : should government be spend money on subsidise multi million pound industry when health education be such sorry state ? answer most definitely no . those people who be enough pursue their passion get pay cheque should not be look government subsidy . I know if I be lucky enough be able pursue my dream show jump I would want finance myself until I be position pursue corporate sponsorship . yes government should fund - it bring joy masse . there be already thousand state - fund musician out there sit , twiddle their thumb on ` ` new deal '' . get government even more involved would waste money could be put well use . as long government be fund real talent it would be great . I would hate see more pop idol - type funding music though , as it would only serve reinforce stereotype alex talk about . only if proposal make financial sense . franz ferdinand be pay serious amount tax on their record sale - if they would have government grant get start they would have than pay it back by now , so treasury would be make far more than it pay out . however government have well thing spend its money on than give charity everyone who decide they musician . government should not ` ` fund '' music - it should ` ` invest '' music those investment should be treat like any other investment . I think government need provide facility group band form practise . equipment not cheap can be well beyond mean many people . however , I do feel this be extent their role , provide condition talent flourish let it go from there . I do agree government should help fund music but there also responsibility by record company ! they generally always opt test tend not want break any mould or risk lose any which ultimately , director be business ! if label be more willing put money forward towards breakthrough act then government would not have fork out great deal . yeah , why not ? music should be fund , particularly work modern composer veteran band / artist stuff .",3
