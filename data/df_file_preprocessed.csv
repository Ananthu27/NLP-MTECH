) they be place suspect terrorist under surveillance maybe acquire sufficient evidence prosecute or even well prevent terrorist attack . do not usually much time mr forsyth 's largely right wing view but this time he get spot . there no doubt there be terrorist organisation who would like do harm u.k . but very doubtful whether al - qaeda global organisation co - ordinate this . rise surveillance camera , i d card , plan charge road use by track every vehicle at all time , this stuff nightmare . add this this new legislation which effectively mean protection law will remove from anyone at whim home secretary , genuinely wonder what sort world my two child will inherit . where will this end . stand terrorist do not need attack u.k .

I will bet any money you like day after any such attack freddie forsyth will say government do not do enough protect uk . people like forsyth can only see one side any argument he side opposite new labour tony blair . agree wholeheartedly mr forsyth . very reason this country be such wonderful place live , under attack , not from terrorist , but from this government . perpetuation perceive terrorist threat not because what ' allege ' terrorist be do , but from our own government . believe what this government do , , at very least , highly questionable at bad , sinister . at what point will they feel they enough control over every single person british isle ; when we be all tag monitor constantly ? our freedom be craftily surreptitiously whittle away by this government we be gain nothing . should great concern everyone . be slightly old than mr forsyth therefore live through same history he . be against police state would not like think live one . think attack iraq make international situation bad may provoke far act terrorism . how true . there be extremely worrying parallel between britain now germany during ' . never think would so easy take over country from within . mr forsyth forget one key point ; terrorist who threaten britain today be well aware hitler , stalin , ira all fail . result modern day terrorist be willing do thing their predecessor do not . do not mean civil liberty modern britain must erode counter threat ; should always absolute last resort . but meet new threat , defeat sinister fanaticism today 's terrorist , we may need do thing little differently . let we hope not . frederic forsythe 's comment seem I well - think - out analysis why we ( human society whole , britain particular ) should resist temptation over - protect through fear . this fear which enable terrorist succeed end , terrorist can come all form , mr . forsythe 's opening comment suggest . be remind quote attribute thomas jefferson . ` ` nation limit freedom name security will neither . '' government be face an incredibly difficult task , make policy deal . be all very well criticise policy , but if mr forsythe can not draw his year experience offer an alternative , say ' so what ? ' his opinion . frederick forsyth 's rhetoric absurd his conclusion laughable . he distort reality serve his own prejudice against new labour . this government seek balance protection our democracy minimum loss civil right . frederick forsyth who extremist , because he do not appreciate need balance . rarely find myself agree my forsyth , but this instance think he correct . rule law must prevail , civil liberty be worth defend . if government can hold ' suspect ' without charge or trial , what be next ? agree absolutely . by introduce fascist type law we loose moral high ground our fight against terror . our democratic system not perfect , but churchill point out ` ` well than all other be try '' . terrorist attack will take place but many reason we should take personal risk return personal freedom . do not usually agree mr . forsyth , but he spot here . single big threat we face government dedicate act illegally manipulate international national law suit its own purpose . totalitarianism always require an outside threat , justify range extraordinary power leader want . british government far great threat terrorist organisation . although , principle agree he , frederick forsyth fail address one key point- al - qaeda attack ( though obviously there be none yet uk ) seek kill maximum number people . ira want limit death toll their attack so maintain support among republican movement . yes , agree mr . forsyth 's view . do not believe government 's plan be justify . there over reaction negative influence we president 's interpretation democracy freedom . he use same argument be current before wwii , war ` ` liberate '' iraq , afghanistan syria iran come . we be leave poor inheritance future generation . mr forsyth wonderful writer should keep his fiction where belong . british government not go down road mr forsyth suggest . sadly comment such his will make lot people believe they be govern by people who be fast become tyrant instead be genuinely commit stop tyranny , even if method employ do at moment alien british people who live democracy protect by tony blair other like mind who , mr . forsyth seem put along side ' scruffy little austrian . ' thomas hobbes would smile his grave at labour 's proposition . like new labour , he call himself libertarian . like new labour , he believe he promote people 's good interest . but forsythe criticise this government , hobbe be criticise by most subsequent philosopher argue his way into hand totalitarian . simply put , he argue favour ultimate liberty liberty live man should prepared surrender all other liberty supreme sovereign , protection against his fellow , barbaric , man . hobbe be roundly condemn by posterity , rightly so . hope new labour suffer same treatment . agree mr forsyth 's view . government approach totally against spirit british democracy . they must not allow get away . course frederick wrong about britain win war against ira he be wrong too about country not become tyranny . he forget about shoot kill , torture , internment without trial , collusion loyalist death squad etc ? my background somewhat similar freddie 's so be persuade agree many his sentiment . we can no moral justification impose our system government anyone while we be systematically deprive our own citizen basic individual collective freedom . whilst principle keep potential terrorist under house arrest might seem superficially attractive , , unfortunately , also first step towards totalitarianism . who decide whom suspect ? why should we believe they ? who can faith honesty , integrity , competence our intelligence service politician light event recent year ? what stop false denunciation ? what those falsely accuse who will lose their career ? who will support their family ? will their child still go school ? smack I method nazi germany , stalin 's russia , ceausescu 's romania list go . look if new dark age come . see opinion mr forsyth 's remark be divide . problem see those who support imprisonment without trial believe will never happen they or their family , only people they do not like or be scared . but history show if you law like , they always get abuse by those power . after all , today you may scare same people those power but someday those power may scared you ! day , you will one imprison without chance justice . our law be such you can not just imprison at whim our police force , you show deserve . if we imprison people without trial an indeterminate period , we be no well those we be fight . never think possible I agree single word utter by frederick forsyth , but I ' m wholehearte agreement he this one . we , nation be grave danger be dupe by pro us propaganda , which course also mean we will inherit most , if not all their total paranoia , allow our government , any political persuasion incidentally , gradually , insidiously , impose police state by well try test back door method . grieve future my child , be no wonder they be adamant they do not ever want any their own . this government , much fanfare , sign we up european convention human right but now want introduce indefinite house arrest without trial . this put par government burma . like many your respondent , would not usually think mr forsyth someone whose view share , but instance oppose charles clark 's proposal house arrest , agree wholeheartedly mr forsyth/ agree mr forsyth . just look at fact our government ( along we ) invade another sovereign country ( iraq ) by select intelligence back 's case base fear . fact turn out very different . if individual be treat same distorted way , then we ' ve do ourselves more damage than any terrorist organisation could bomb . we become animal too . agree many way what mr forsyth if we be respected influence within world we must see walk walk well talk talk how can we accuse country such zimbabwe burma human right abuse when we be lock up people who may totally innocent , hypocrisy high order . mr forsyth links ` ` islamic fundamentalism '' new ` ` threat '' . however appear he misunderstood term ` ` islamic fundamentalism '' . should point out muslim who adhere true fundamental qur'aan teaching last prophet muhammad an islamic fundamentalist . this person do not commit suicide any shape or form , nor do she / he kill innocent woman , man child . this person self - reflective constantly try well her / his action by be good other . people who mr forsyth label new ` ` threat '' be those who do not follow correct teaching islam . they arrive at their own interpretation assumption regard their action . top , they claim follow islam its true form ! accept intention these policy be make britain safe place but can not think single example from history where do this sort thing ever make any difference northern ireland internment certainly do not achieve anything bombing do not stop , could argue all achieve just supply ira yet more angry resentful republicans willing take up arm against british . be eight year old than frederick forsyth survivor blitz london , easy agree he , he absolutely spot . during ira bombing there be massive explosion canary wharf , right where write this , also leave city london . notwithstanding these attempt nearly successful assassination attempt prime minister thatcher brighton later occupant down street , there no retaliatory blitz belfast or dublin there be afghanistan iraq . even when england true peril apart from some detention there be no wholesale derogation habeas corpus like . we see off these late attempt our liberty include i d card , which winston churchill decide have go since , he , average bobby beat could not rely not tempt take undue advantage against citizen go about their lawful activity ( incidentally can still remember my old i d card number ) . hence clear far too great police state power set statute book resist neutered . what can add mr . forsyth 's eloquently put argument ... except applause ! well do man stand up be count ` ` war against tyranny '' .",0

I ' m rapidly redifine ' good ' my own head now mean ' most gratuitously play at wedding funeral because people think deep meaning ' . what about britpop ? blur , oasis , suede , pulp ... not only make fantastic song but also make change , do something different . why must ' good ' always come down most commercially popular ? I ' ve nothing against robbie , actually like his music , but how can this possibly good song from last 25year ? brit prove nothing more than bargaining tool between pop mogul boost band profile record sale . same go scissor sister , think this superb record thoroughly deserve newcomer award , but album come no where near u2 's new record , neither be they same league . once again there be some baffle discision make , they be not artisic reason , but profit . no surprise really , be vote by general public . since when do they taste music ? personally find angel by robbie williams one most irritate song ever hear ! absolutely deserve win . song united generation will continue play many year come . be an absolute joke , however most original be very poor choice well . all all pretty pointless exercise song overplay oversentimental . out rather poor five choice be leave , should go either joy division or queen . suppose we should thankful do not end up hand will young though . although nostalgia value , there no way deserve win . everybody know word bohemian rhapsody , nothing compare u , etc . much well song more timeless . give someone real talent . although angel good song think anyone slight musical taste will realise this not good song last year . this just another example record company manipulation keep an artist public eye . why not give he an award great pair trouser if be all mean !",3

I ' m not really comfortable word urban . 's word be be manufacture this country america describe black music . word urban seem cover such broad range black music 's wrong . how far be brit remove from inner - city music what people be do ? be so far remove do not expect they get bang . music industry not champion music from our particular genre very well anyway . people do not feel like 's anything do we . do not feel like urban music be just be celebrate by [ joss stone ] win or she be nominate , or by brit acknowledge there be an urban music scene because be all kick tooth at end day . be not really relevant . if joss stone close thing they feel comfortable championing because what she look like how she sound who she be sign , then so . be get nothing do what be really go . urban genre very broad . if you look underneath urban , there be number core element include hip - hop , r & b , garage into obviously come soul . joss stone soul artist . her first album call soul session . so urban very broad brushstroke umbrella over top sub - genre , there be offshoot all those . joss stone have amazing success [ we ] give she be uk artist . what really capture everybody 's imagination here you -year - old from devon voice die bunch really , really good tune she look good think be what be do . award good british urban act vote by viewer mtv base . do not think joss not worthy winner . she make soul music definitely come under category what we describe urban . fact she be from devon interesting thing because most music we cover make large city she be literally rural . great thing about urban music there be big range . if there some sort root black music or dance music britain , think 's where you can call urban 's where this new sub - category , or uber - category , come from . joss stone certainly not old enough have some experience an old soul singer , but you could not argue she be inauthentic her emotion come from somewhere genuine . come across real . 's only cut - off point we here be only way by which we judge people . what urban mean we an organisation politically correct term describe music which originate from black background . music should become inclusive if we be fight multi - cultural britain , then we should fight inclusion rather than exclusion . if joss stone can accept within urban music community , think act from other ethnicity do classical music rock should accept too . race do not make difference if everyone include . out all award dish out yesterday , I ' m still trying find out what people other race receive any sort recognition or award . type music ( especially street music ) originate from city , typically reflect or characteristic urban life . she might not urban , but when do r & b become hip hop taint thing now ? r & b stand rhythm blue , remember ! joss stone rubbish certain . if anyone deserve win an award urban music ( I think probably should include hip - hop , soul funk at least but not rock or pop ) this year its street , although dizzee rascal stake good claim she definitely deserve win prize , joss stone 's album be quite simply amazing , easily well than anything else release last year . this whole debate about what urban , what be not urban completely pointless probably fuel by urban artist who be not nominate or do not win . can not see why people can not just congratulate her talent she . she do deserve , but agree comment about urban music . its stupid phrase , particularly british . state they tend use hip hop r & b , if say hip hop here lot people no idea what I ' m talk about . very strange . what be name ? rise by any other name etc ... if people want call urban , why not ? if we really analyse , term ' dance music ' misleading because do not describe everything you can dance . whilst agree term ' urban ' open interpretation , strike I simply weird joss stone win . ' urban ' I what hear be play party inner city live brixton never hear soul session pump out bass heavy sound system any party I ' ve be . good luck joss stone , let us celebrate her victory let us also question why , artist so successful talented jamelia , lemar , kanye west , dizzee rascal , alicia key outkast we do not see single black artist stage collect an award . so , what you be say any music black heritage not allow sing by anyone who not black . , if , then they should not acknowledge even if they be pretty dam good at ? she be , an amazing voice , win . good she . oh , but she be not ` ` black '' well , let us make she feel real bad about then . how dare she ! though hang , do not so - call ' public ' vote this one ? this idea pigeonhole whatever popular at time no different than what happen 1940 50 relation what ` ` jazz '' . medium then call anything have swinge beat , syncopate melody or soulful feeling ` ` jazz '' , much chagrin artist . would mean ` ` blue '' would put same mould ` ` bebop '' , ` ` cool '' ` ` ragtime '' , all very different style at time . jazz remain such massively misunderstood term . so what ` ` urban '' music ? truth 's lazy term categorise music you do not really understand . soul garage be world apart musically ( marvin gaye tuff jam ? ) , but no doubt their connection . if we just let music speak itself not judge success an artist by number award win , then maybe we can enjoy music what , rather than what represent . demand prize rural music ! suck cities- 's way well out here . we hay , one thing . exclude she from what become know urban music would bad exclude lenny kravitz or hendrix from rock music be black surely ? do not understand point ty making . if lemar , who make music which less soulful than joss ' work win , he might nothing . ( btw I ' m black too ) how can she ` ` urban '' if she spend most her life devon countryside ? nonsense . love joss bit do not care what her branding 's amazing music , full stop . stop put all bracket let us just call music , let us especially drop black urban tag nearly all music come from black origin , this just set an example ok pigeonhole people their music by their colour . surely point have an urban music category simply acknowledge artist be make what ( historically ) consider urban music , irrelevent colour their skin , or where they originate from . joss stone simply singe certain type music can consider urban style , just someone from an inner city , indeed not from usa could sing country music . if person good at authentic sound , would we criticise be refer country music or artist represent style ? term urban reference music genre uk develop , part , from controversy surround brand mobo award . very term ' music black origin ' confuse offend many people . this particularly strange give existence asian music award . appear use ' black ' or ' white ' relation music make people feel uncomfortable . term ' urban ' therefore , be invoke sidestep debate which type music come first ' black ' or ' white ' thereby render issue colourblind . result now redundant new debate what ' urban ' also mean . perhaps we should create new term altogether describe various strain soul / rnb hip - hop , one which do not also mean something else we do ' crunk ' . urban just word be come about recently describe ` ` black '' music be become popular now . word not even use , or common use five six year ago . be just way industry clumping all together without have call black music , because some people be oversensitive might call they racist . I ' m band be call ` ` urban '' , despise label . I would hate think belong any neat marketing niche , because be all . ever since music channel record comapnie try fracture what they consider ' music black origin ' , these label be use undermine status good music into commodity . look at all tv broadcaster , unable reach young people without condesende , they simply play some ' urban ' music soundtrack if its some dreadful cheap lift music . ignore label , what , just music . black man , think agree some statement at least statement make by key executive . black people should lead music they invent we should stop call genre meaningless , northe meaningless . real question would joss stone would be successful do music she do if she be black ? same thing , street , amy winehouse , etc . who be ever hear terri walker or rhian benson .. they be both time well than joss stone both they win urban music award think mobo but why not brit ? ? ? ? so what if joss stone win urban award . her music great soul surely under ' urban ' banner ? what if street have win ? would people whine because mike skinner white ... seem lot fuss about race where real issue should music nothing else . urban pc version say black music . I ' m not doubt ms stone 's talent , but why do not jamelia or lemar get brit ? this remind I what happen craig david soul ii soul past , get nomination be easy get , but pick up brit seem hard thing . refreshing see people make reasonable , intelligent comment any topic these day . more power you , people ! you : there music you like music you do not like who care what label you put ? entire category mess . how can you people like dizzee rascal up against joss stone ? its like put eminem against bob geldof . she should be nominate good british act . joss stone deserve win an award her talent , but do not think very ' urban ' her sing angel robbie williams . urban nonsense term music black origin ? well do not include rock ? music make inner city ? well almost all band end up make music london / manchester etc . do not make some weird implication all black people live city ? do not make any sense . why do music put into genre ? 's music , you like or you do not . simple . play heavy metal band . we be urban music far I ' m concerned . we live city spend our work life an urban environment ; therefore directly shape what we write musically . ` ` urban '' seem new name all style black music . why need rebrand do not know name misleading . oasis originate from city characterise urban life they know , therefore more than fit term ` ` urban '' yet they be white rock band they will not describe such . joss stone fantastic voice great timing delivery what other reason do they need award her brit ? all this ` ` urban '' other such categorisation just red - tape music business well ignore . yeah , she deserve . she talente . urban crap , meaningless , politically correct probably actually racist marketing term though . there be only two kind music : good bad .",3
